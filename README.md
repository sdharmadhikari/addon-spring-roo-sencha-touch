Work in Progress !

Spring Roo addon helps create client side Sencha Touch MVC code for CRUD operations ! 

It takes good amount of time to create Sencha Touch code to match with back-end server database entities. In fact, its time consuming duplication of effort to create same database entities clones on Sencha Touch MVC Model/Store/Form and lists. This addon for Spring Roo saves this times and kickstarts Sencha Touch development by creating Scaffolded application.

This addon will read Spring Roo generated entities and it's attributes and will create its Sencha Touch clones in MVC pattern. It will create separte controller, form, model , store for each server entity. 

Sencha TOuch developer can take the code further to add app specific functionality.

The Sencha Touch Reference project is at https://github.com/sdharmadhikari/roo-addon-reference-sencha-project.
This is reference for code generation.
