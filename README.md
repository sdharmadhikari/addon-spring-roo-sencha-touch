It takes good amount of time to create Sencha Touch code to map with back-end server database entities. Its time consuming duplication of effort to create same database entities clones on Sencha Touch MVC Model/Store/Form and lists. This addon for Spring Roo saves this time and kickstarts Sencha Touch development by creating scaffolded application.

This addon will read Spring Roo generated entities and it's attributes and will create its Sencha Touch clones in MVC pattern. It creates separte controller, form, model , store for each server entity. 

Once the scaffolded application is generated, developer can modifiyt code further to add app specific functionality.

The supporting, Sencha Touch Reference project is at https://github.com/sdharmadhikari/roo-addon-reference-sencha-project.
Sencha Touch code from this project will be used as code templates for this main project.
